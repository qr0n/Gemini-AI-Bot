# Version 0.5-alpha (JSON)

#### This is the first ever private version of Iron Nugget (Gemini-AI-Bot)

# Differences

## 1. JSON Cleaners
#### These cleaners allow the JSON generated by Gemini to be parsed correctly and have the Markdown formatting removed

```json
{"hello!" : "I'm JSON Markdown"}
```

## 2. JSON drop-in-replacement for SQL
#### This is highly experimental, so if it doesn't work just send me a message on discord with the error so I can just fix it and send you the updated one

## 3. Better config.json
#### This config.json reduces the clutter and un-needed configuration points such as the removal of SQL config points and the not implemented Free Will

## 4. Additional documentation
#### This code has been scanned through thoroghly and documentation has been created where it was not previously

## 5. Message chunking
#### This feature allows Nugget to send messages that are greater than 2000 characters in multiple messages

## 6. Request Monitering
#### More indepth details of how many RPM (requests per message) you're sending

### If you plan on publishing this please remove the version card and version. The same license applies. Happy modding!
