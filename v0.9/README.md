# Version 0.9-alpha (JSON)

# Differences

## 1. JSON Cleaners
#### These cleaners allow the JSON generated by Gemini to be parsed correctly and have the Markdown formatting removed

```json
{"hello!" : "I'm JSON Markdown"}
```

## 2. JSON drop-in-replacement for SQL
#### This is highly experimental, so if it doesn't work just send me a message on discord with the error so I can just fix it and send you the updated one

## 3. Better config.json
#### This config.json reduces the clutter and un-needed configuration points such as SQL login

## 4. Message chunking
#### This feature allows Nugget to send messages that are greater than 2000 characters in multiple messages
